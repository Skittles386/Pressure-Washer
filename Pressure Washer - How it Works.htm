<p align="center"> <font color="#2F4F4F">When we were working on the pressure washer, we took off the ignition coil. The way our ignition coil works <br>
is by using a flywheel which has a small magnetic plate which passes a point to create an electrical charge to ignite the spark <br>
plug. The flywheel turns by pulling a cord that is connected to a plastic piece that will turn the flywheel and create a spark in the piston <br>
chamber. After the spark of the piston chamber goes off, it will ignite the fuel and produce an explosion that moves <br>
the camshaft. The camshaft powers whatever it is attached to, making the components spin and work.</font> </p>
